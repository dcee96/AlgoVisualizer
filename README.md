# Algo Visualizer
This is a small web app that shows how different algorithms perform with a visual representation.

To run it first drag the Start and end nodes anywhere on the grid. Then you can click on any of the empty spaces to create a "wall". once you have finished click on either one of the two Algorithms to see it run. to reset the whole grid hit "reset" and if you just want to try a different Algorithm then click 
"reset Algo".
